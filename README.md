# Latex-Editor
Latex is a well known high quality document preparation markup language. It provides a large variety of styles and commands that enable advanced document formatting. Typically, a Latex document is compiled with a tool like MikTex, Lyx, etc. to produce a respective formatted document in pdf, ps, etc. Formatting documents with Latex is a programming like process as it involves the proper usage of Latex commands which are embedded in the document contents.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a simple Latex editor for inexperienced Latex users. The goal of the editor is to facilitate the usage of Latex commands for the preparation of Latex documents. One of the prominent features that distinguishes the LatexEditor from other similar applications is its multi-strategy version tracking functionalities that enable undo and redo actions.
